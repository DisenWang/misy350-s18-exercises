We use __this file__ to practice markdown

We have tried
1. `git clone`: this is how you copy/download a repo
1. `git status`: this show the status of the current repo
1. `git add .` : this stages all changes for commit
1. `git commit -am "commit msg"`: this commits the changes to the repo with a message
1. `git log`: this lists all of your commits for this repo
1. `git checkout hash`: this rolls back to a previous commit
1. `git checkout master`: returns to latest commits
1. `git push`:
