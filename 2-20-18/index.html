    <h2>What is Parkour?</h2>
    <p>Parkour is the act of moving from point “a” to point “b” using the obstacles in your path to increase your efficiency. It has since then developed to be an expression of freedom of movement, where athletes incorporate more self-expression, improvisation,
      and the use of movements for aesthetics-only, such as flips and twists.</p>
